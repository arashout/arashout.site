# Why Dancing Should Be Your New Hobby
Another wave of coronavirus means another wave of stricter lock-down rules just in time for the winter holidays. Pretty depressing overall, especially if you used to be like me and all your old hobbies involved physical activity at the gym (climbing or otherwise).   
But I'm managing to maintain my sanity, and it's a large part due to **my new hobby... Dancing**.     

## My Story
That's honestly something I thought I would never say. Even though I'm a fairly outgoing and confident person, for most of my life I've been a terrible and unwilling dancer. I'd go as far as saying that I had an affliction... Where the mere thought of having to dance in front of other people would give me anxiety and would cause me to freeze... You know, "like a deer in headlights".     

I'm sure that many readers can relate, especially if your upbringing was somewhat similar to mine. Growing up, I essentially didn't have any creative hobbies, I mostly stuck to the things I was good at. Sports and video games. I just assumed that was how my brain was wired, that I was just a logical engineer type like my mom and dad, and that I didn't have the temperament to even learn how to dance.

But obviously something changed, or I wouldn't be here writing this article. It wasn't sudden, I had a bunch of false starts.    
When I was 23, I moved to London, UK for a job opportunity. I had no friends and going to the gym wasn't really helping that much, so I thought it was time to branch out and try some different hobbies.    
I tried learning a brazilian social dance called ["Forr√≥"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forr%C3%B3), this ended horribly because I only went to the classes and would never stay long at the socials. The socials are the actual dance parties, where you can practice what you learned and improve. I couldn't last more than one or two dances at the socials because I was just so bad. It literally felt like I was **inflicting myself** on these poor followers who were there to have a good time. The followers were nice enough, they obviously didn't insult me or anything, as they knew everyone starts somewhere. But in my own head I couldn't really handle the uncomfortable-ness of being that bad at something. Especially coming from a sports background, where I would generally be pretty good at any new sport I tried. So I spent a month or two going to classes and not getting better, and eventually quitting.     
   
Afterwards, I tried my hand at some absolute beginner urban dance (Urban dance encompasses styles like Hip Hop, House, etc...) classes. These were actually pretty fun, I had an especially good time when we did a House module within that class and I made a friend or two. I still however wasn't really comfortable dancing at all, even in class I was terrified of not finding a place in the back of the studio. I finished those classes but didn't end up taking anymore. 

The main reason for not continuing with the dance classes, was because I had started Bouldering (Indoor Rock Climbing Without Rope) and that was way more in my comfort zone and much easier for me to make friends. The climbing community is awesome and I have no regrets spending the majority of my free time at the climbing gym. But it did mean that I would drop dancing until a couple years later...



- I realized the first step in being good is being bad
## The Reasons

### It's Fun
- It's not at the beginning but once you get over the initial hump, it's alright
- There's an endorphin rush everytime you "hit" the proper beats and sounds in the music.

### You Can Do It Solo
- Extremely relevant in the covid era. 
- Obviously not as much fun, but still something to do and improve at

### You Can Do It For Awhile
- Depending on the style it can be a fairly low impact sport. Which means you can do it well into old age
    - One of the most inspiring things was saying much older dancers 

### There's Always More To Learn

### It Will Help You "Loosen Up"
