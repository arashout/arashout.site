# Why Dancing Should Be Your New Hobby
Another wave of coronavirus means another wave of stricter lock-down rules just in time for the winter holidays. Pretty depressing overall, especially if you used to be like me and all your old hobbies involved physical activity at the gym (climbing or otherwise).   
But I'm managing to maintain my sanity, and it's a large part due to **my new hobby... Dancing**.     

In a previous [post]() I explain how I got started. In this post I want to enumerate some reasons why you might want to start as well.

## The Reasons

### It's Fun
- It's not at the beginning but once you get over the initial hump, it's alright
- There's an endorphin rush everytime you "hit" the proper beats and sounds in the music.

### You Can Do It Solo
- Extremely relevant in the covid era. 
- Obviously not as much fun, but still something to do and improve at

### You Can Do It For Awhile
- Depending on the style it can be a fairly low impact sport. Which means you can do it well into old age
    - One of the most inspiring things was saying much older dancers 

### There's Always More To Learn

### It Will Help You "Loosen Up"
