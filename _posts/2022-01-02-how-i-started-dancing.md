# The VERY Long Story of How I Started Dancing

## Why Are You Telling Me This
This is a very long and frankly rumbly post, but I thought it might be worth sharing because I know that when I was struggling with the anxiety of taking dance classes or even continuing to go to dance classes when I was bad, a long rumbly post about learning to dance from the perspective of a mid-twenties guy who found the idea of moving to music foreign would have been extremely comfortable and motivational. So keep that in mind, as you slug (or skim) through this post.   

## Thankful for this new hobby

Another wave of coronavirus means another wave of stricter lock-down rules just in time for the winter holidays. Pretty depressing overall, especially if you used to be like me and all your old hobbies involved physical activity at the gym (climbing or otherwise).   
But I'm managing to maintain my sanity, and it's a large part due to **my new hobby... Dancing**.     

## I thought dancing wasn't for me

**That's honestly something I thought I would never say**. Even though I'm a fairly outgoing and confident person, for most of my life I've been a terrible and unwilling dancer. I'd go as far as saying that I had an affliction... Where the mere thought of having to dance in front of other people would give me anxiety and would cause me to freeze... You know, "like a deer in headlights".     

I'm sure that many readers can relate, especially if your upbringing was somewhat similar to mine. Growing up, I essentially didn't have any creative hobbies, I mostly stuck to the things I was good at. Sports and video games. I just assumed that was how my brain was wired, that I was just a logical engineer type like my mom and dad, and that I didn't have the temperament to even learn how to dance.

## The seed is planted

But obviously something changed, or I wouldn't be here writing this article. It wasn't sudden, I had a bunch of false starts.    
When I was 23, I moved to London, UK for a job opportunity. I had no friends and going to the gym wasn't really helping that much, so I thought it was time to branch out and try some different hobbies.    
I tried learning a brazilian social dance called ["ForrÃ³"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forr%C3%B3), this ended horribly because I only went to the classes and would never stay long at the socials. The socials are the actual dance parties, where you can practice what you learned and improve. I couldn't last more than one or two dances at the socials because I was just so bad. It literally felt like I was **inflicting myself** on these poor followers who were there to have a good time. The followers were nice enough, they obviously didn't insult me or anything, as they knew everyone starts somewhere. But in my own head I couldn't really handle the uncomfortable-ness of being that bad at something. Especially coming from a sports background, where I would generally be pretty good at any new sport I tried. So I spent a month or two going to classes and not getting better, and eventually quitting.     
   
Afterwards, I tried my hand at some absolute beginner urban dance (Urban dance encompasses styles like Hip Hop, House, etc...) classes. These were actually pretty fun, I had an especially good time when we did a House module within that class and I made a friend or two. I still however wasn't really comfortable dancing at all, even in class I was terrified of not finding a place in the back of the studio. I finished those classes but didn't end up taking anymore. 

The main reason for not continuing with the dance classes, was because I had started Bouldering (indoor rock climbing without Rope) and that was way more in my comfort zone and much easier for me to make friends. The climbing community is awesome and I have no regrets spending the majority of my free time at the climbing gym. But it did mean that I would drop dancing until a couple years later...

## Fast Forward To 2019
Sometime in the fall of 2019, after I had graduated and landed a job, *thus officially becoming an adult*. I decided that I would give this dancing thing one more try. And this time I wouldn't settle for half-measures. I basically **created a contract** for myself, I would try my absolute hardest for a year, fully willing to look stupid and to embarrass myself. And in return, if after a year I didn't improve much and still didn't enjoy it I could quit all together and never look back. A bit dramatic I know, but it made me feel good knowing that I could finally give up and just say, *"I tried, I'm just not a dancer"*, and then I could just avoid it forever.   
Before I go on, I think it's really important to state why (*I think*) I had this perspective shift. Sometime in the year before I read [A Guide to the Good Life: The Ancient Art of Stoic Joy](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2425809289?book_show_action=false&from_review_page=1), Stoicism (*As I understood it*) was all about not letting things you CANNOT control affect your mood, and by the same token taking responsibility for the things that you CAN control. I think this was one of the main sparks the idea of the contract. My thought process was as follows:
1. I'm tired of being nervous and anxious to dance in front of others
2. If dancing is something I can improve at, then I should put in some concentrated effort to get over my fear and learn to enjoy it
    - Concentrated effort meant (somewhat arbitrarily), one year of gritting my teeth and trying my hand at whatever dance style is most convenient
3.  Otherwise, if I try in earnest to improve and nothing comes of it, I can give myself permission to avoid all dancing endeavors, parties or social scenarios where I might be forced to dance without any guilt.

I think some might say, that the above is still not really a healthy attitude towards dance, because were all humans and dancing is natural for everyone, or that I should enjoy it even if I suck. Well, unfortunately that's not really how my brain works, or maybe I haven't reached that state of *not giving a fuck* where I can do something that I know I'm terrible at with no chance of improvement. I bring this up mainly because there are many posts on reddit (Where I go whenever I'm in need of advice...) seem to maintain this viewpoint. *Get a little alcohol in you, and you'll have a blast dancing at the party* OR *Look at this dad, at this wedding, he doesn't care what he looks like he's having fun!*. You know, stuff like that. My general abstinence from alcohol notwithstanding, I didn't want to go about it that way.   
   
So for me, doing the mental gymnastics inspired by stoic principles with a guilt free escape hatch is what finally allowed me to take the plunge.

## A Little Bit Of Preaching
Again it's really hard to overstate how important this perspective shift was for me. If you don't take anything else out of this blog post (and think my writing is crap ðŸ˜¢ ), the reason I was able to face my (dancing) fears was because I was able to get over the mental hurdles I had set for myself about being embarrassed, being terrible at it and not improving. Maybe the logical reasoning I used might not resonate with you, but you would be really be doing yourself a dis-service if you didn't find a similar set of mental tools to force yourself to do stuff that's uncomfortable but potentially beneficial.

## Trying To Find My Niche
With my hardened resolve I went about trying to find a dance style I could learn for the next year. The search wasn't particularly interesting. I wanted to try my hand at partner dancing again, to have a common hobby with my potential girlfriend who I planned to hopefully meet in one of the classes. It would be a two birds, one stone type scenario kind of deal.   
I initially tried East Coast Swing at [Royal City Swing](https://www.royalcityswing.com/) where there was a beginner class and social on Friday Nights. The community there was really great (Although it did skew older...) and I almost instantly made some new friends. However, I just realized that I didn't really like Swing music, so I could never really get into the dance.    

At this point I was starting to get a glimpse of all the different dancing styles that were available in Vancouver. I didn't want to start with a Latin dance, because I wasn't sure if I would like the music similar to East Coast Swing. But *East* Coast Swing was my jumping off point to *West* Coast Swing. West Coast Swing is great, because it's a modern dance that you can dance to modern music. That was really appealing to me because so far my most harrowing experiences had been at (persian) weddings were there was always a dance floor and people were dragging you on to the stage to dance to whatever was playing at the time.   
And even better was that there was a [studio]() right beside my parents place. I'm a sucker for convenience, so I signed up for a semester almost immediately.
