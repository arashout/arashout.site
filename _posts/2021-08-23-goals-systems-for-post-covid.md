# Inspiration
After reading [Atomic Habits](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40121378-atomic-habits), I felt inspired to jot down my plans and habits that I want to cultivate this year.   

For me the year really starts in September, as the education system has warped how I see the year's progression; Summer is a time for rest and rejuvenation and Fall is the time to make plans that you'll wish you didn't commit to come Winter time.
As you can see, my schedule is simply shifted approximately half a year from the rest of the world. I make my New Year's resolutions in September.   



# Become Part of the Running Community
I recently moved into a studio apartment in East Vancouver; which means that I am paying an outrageous amount in rent. 

Thus it's a necessity that I make the most of it. I'm honestly not abundantly clear what that means to ME, YET, 
but for now I think a worthy goal is to go to as many running clubs/groups/events as I can. Especially if they are located near me; most of them are.
