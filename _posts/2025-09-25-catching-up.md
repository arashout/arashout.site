It's been a while since I've made a system post, but I've been feeling really lost and directionless lately and it's been making me miserable, and I've read that externalizing your feelings can help, soo here comes a brain dump.

I guess a small catch up since the last post is in order, just so when I read this in the future I can remember what the hell (what the helly) I was thinking.

I've pretty much dropped all the hobbies and habits I was working on in the last post üôÅ

I still love dancing, and sometimes I really miss working on it and sessioning with my friends but after Shimba left back for Japan, I kind of lost the wind in my sails. Felt like I had a really good connection with him and don't really know if I can find someone (or something) that makes me want to dance and cypher like he did.

On the other hand, I was actually bouldering pretty aggressively in months leading up to August, but then I got some elbow tendinitis that's taken me out of commission. It's still really annoying making myself commute and if I'm being honest I didn't even want to go in the summer months cause the gym was so damn hot.

Anyway, so I guess recently I'm not running, bouldering or dancing as much as I used to.

The one bright spot is that I seemed to have resolved my persistent sleep issues with a prescription of Mirtazapone. I was looking back at my journal entries from the last 2 years and half them are sleep related. I'm taking a really small doses so I'm hoping I don't build a tolerance for a long time. It's been a couple months (I started in February after my Japan trip)

Oh yeah! I went to Japan with my girlfriend and her brother + friend, it was really fun. She's super cool and easy to travel with. I usually hate travelling but it was fun with her. I love her lots. ‚ù§Ô∏è

Now that I think about it a lot of stuff that I know I wouldn't enjoy by myself, are actually kind of fun when she comes.

( On a related note, I wonder if it's worth posting pictures / videos here. That'd be kind of neat, but I guess it depends what type of vibe I'm going for. )

Anyway so that's pretty much all that's happened in the last 3 years üôÇ
