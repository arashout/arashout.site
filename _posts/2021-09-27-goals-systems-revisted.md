I had a plan (read: an event in my calender) to review my post about [goals and systems]({{ '_posts/2021-08-23-goals-systems-for-post-covid.md' | relative_url }}) which I came up with after reading [Atmoic Habits](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40121378-atomic-habits). So I guess it's *REFLECTION TIME*.    
   
I think the best way to go about this is to leave some of the text from the original post in a block quote and then comment on top of that.    


# Running
> but for now I think a worthy goal is to go to as many running clubs/groups/events as I can. Especially if they are located near me; most of them are. 

```
## Participate in the East Vancouver Running Club Runs on Monday's at 6:30PM
## Participate in the Central Park Park Run Saturday's at 9AM 
### *Bonus* Volunteer At-Least Once a Month
## *Bonus* Participate in the Icecream & Donut Park Run
## *Bonus* Stay After the Run To Mingle
```

## On Mingling and Making Friends
A worthy goal indeed. I'm glad I made this a focus, because I've made some good friends this way. I'm still a bit shy about staying after the run to mingle.   

The only run that I usually stick around afterwards are the "Icecream and Donut Run Club", the main reason being that I'm just much more motivated to eat icecream or a donut then to drink beer. It's a shame too because there's some really cool people at the other run groups that I could be getting much closer with if I was willing to stay.

## Other Run Clubs


# Career
## Developing A Personal Brand??

## Nix + Bazel

# Climbing

My concrete goal would be to be able to project Hex 4's at the Hive consistently and maybe even complete an odd Hex 5.     
The plan overall is just to climb more but without getting injured. Which is honestly a difficult feat because basically I have to avoid consecutive days of climbing; Hard to do on weekends.   
## Climb 3-4 Times a Week 
## Hangboard 1-2 Times a Week
Sometimes I wonder if I enjoy hangboarding more than I like climbing? It sounds stupid but I think the tangible progress is more satisfying...
Anyway I'm going to gradually add some hangboarding sessions to build up the finger strength as I keep better hopefully.    
I don't want to be stupid and hangboard more than 2 times a week but they are hard to recover from and it will cut into my time to actually get better at climbing.
## Climb Outdoors Before The Season Ends!

# Dancing
## Go To 1 WCS Social A Week

# Diet
## Intermittent Fast 18-6 Protocol Daily
