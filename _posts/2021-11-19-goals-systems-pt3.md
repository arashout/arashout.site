I have a day off at work and my priorities have changed a ton since last time. So I thought I would go ahead and comment on how much my priorities have shifted.     
It's crazy going through and writing these posts every couple of months made me realize that I'm a huge flip-flopper. Like my priorities keep changing every-time I write one of these. It's a bit disturbing really, I used to think of myself as a much more consistent person. Oh well, I guess it's good to break false illusions about yourself.    

# Dance
✅ *Previous Post*
> So instead I'd like to focus on House dancing instead because there's still a decent number of classes and I can practice solo.   

Probably the biggest priority change in the last couple of months has been how often I'm attending House dance lessons. I never realized how many dance studios taught House (Or maybe I've just been living under a rock?), because I'm having a great time going to them.    
There have been a couple mis-steps, where I accidentally attended some classes they were way TOO HARD. But overall, it's been really fun and I'm even practicing solo so that I can get better faster.

>Having said that I don't want to drop WCS (I'm still going to class and taking some privates) but I won't focus too hard on it for now.   

So I pretty much ended up dropping WCS. It was a hard decision but I just felt like I wasn't improving that much without the "Socials". I'll re-visit once covid restrictions open up and allow dancing in large numbers. Bummer 😢  ...

🔑 *System Habits*
- Go to at-least 2 House Dance classes a week (including progressives)
    - Anymore is somewhat counter-productive as I don't have time to actually practice and absorb what I learned in class
- Practice 2x/week
    - Solo drilling and practice is where I actually notice the most improvement
- (For Fun) Explore some other styles. (Afro? Hip-hop?)

# Running
🤷  *Previous Post* 
> but for now I think a worthy goal is to go to as many running clubs/groups/events as I can. Especially if they are located near me; most of them are.  

This one is kind of a wash. Leading up to the half-marathon race I was actually doing a ton of running and going to most of these running clubs. After I finished the race, I pretty much stopped going to most of the events.     
I still go to a couple of the run clubs here and there but I'm definitely not as consistent. 

🔑 *System Habits*
- Run at-least 3x a week (long run, speed work, easy run)
    - Maintain 20-30km a week to be ready if I decide to do a race

# Diet
👀  *Previous Post* 
> This has been super hard to do while running so many miles.   
I'll have to re-visit this after the race.   
  
> I'm still trying to stick with it, but definitely not as strict as before. Mainly making sure to fuel up before the hard strength training sessions no matter what.   

I basically lost no weight and in fact gained some weight. It's been hard to stick with it.   
At-least when I was climbing a ton it was extremely motivating to be lean and low weight. Now, not as much.     

My biggest problem has just been binging. I have to will myself to not eat more than a meals worth in a single setting.

Either way, it's time to get back on it. 
🔑 *System Habits*
- 16-8 Fasting Protocol
    - Let's lower the difficulty so I'm more likely to actually stick with it
- Figure out a system for not binging

# Strength Training
👌  *Previous Post* 
> This is one area that I think I have mostly figured out. I've dropped 531 and opted for **Reverse Pyramid Training (RPT) full-body 3x week**. The benefits are as follows:
I pretty much stuck to this for the most part.    
I'm not sure if it was ideal though because:
- I had trouble maintaining intensity with cutting/running
- I didn't see that much improvement because my diet was all over the place.

However the 3x/week is a good frequency. So I'm going to stick with that and switch to 531 Full-body 3x a week. Maybe add an additional day for some more pressing for the calisthenics stuff. Pretty simple...

🔑 *System Habits*
- 3x/week 531 + Additional pressing

# Career/Personal Growth
❌ *Previous Post* 
> The only idea I really have so far is to write as much as I can,

I've done a terrible job of building a personal brand. I wrote a blog post for the company that got rejected and I've been de-motivated ever since.   
I should probably set a more realistic goal than writing a ton. Maybe sharing personal projects or writing a short (very short) piece about something I worked on every week?

❌ *Previous Post* 
> In particular, Nix and Bazel. This year I really want to focus on trying to learn more about those technologies, write about them and build tools for the company and personal projects using them.
Didn't do a great job learning any additional Nix or Bazel on my own. HOWEVER, I have managed to grab some developer productivity work and I expect it won't be long before I get even more familiar with them. I need to start using Nix/Bazel in some of my own personal projects to really improve.   
They do seem to be a hot topic, as I seem to be getting lot's of recruiter messages based off a brief blurb I have about them.

🔑 *System Habits*
- Continue to work on personal projects like Habitica-Strava Integration
    - Use interesting technologies (Bazel, Terraform, Nix, Elixir, Rust) for fun and (eventual) profit

# Bouldering
I basically stopped bouldering. I dropped in recently and it was definitely fun, but I'm just not sure if it's a sustainable habit for me. I'm not going to bother with any systems for climbing because it's just not important to me anymore. Crazy how much things change in a span of months 🤣
