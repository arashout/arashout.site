<h1>Unfortunately the bookmarklet no longer works. Sorry!</h1>

<h1>What it does:</h1>
<p>
    Beautifies the lacking unofficial UBC transcript with extra information and better formatting.
</p>
<h1>How it does this:</h1>
<p>It does this in several ways:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Adding a course names columns</li>
    <li>Removing unnecessary widgets</li>
    <li>Spacing items out better and increasing the width of the table </li>
    <li>Allow you to manually edit course names</li>
    <li>Optionally allow you to remove unnecessary columns + rows</li>
</ul>

<h1>Instructions</h1>
<ol class="with-bullets">
    <li>
        <p>Go to <a class="colour-link" href="{{ page.ubcapi }}">this page</a> check that the API status is ONLINE and
            drag the bookmarklet onto your bookmarks bar</p>
        <p>NOTE: This bookmarklet works best with Google Chrome and hasn't been tested with other browsers!</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Navigate to the <a class="colour-link"
                href="https://ssc.adm.ubc.ca/sscportal/servlets/SRVSSCFramework?function=SessGradeRpt">SSC grades
                page</a>
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Click on the bookmarklet to run it</p>
        <p>It might take the server some time to boot up the first time you run it.</p>
    </li>
</ol>

<h1>How it works</h1>
There are two main components that make up the UBC Transcript Beautifier
<h2>Bookmarklet (Client-Side)</h2>
There is the client side (On the user's browser) bookmarklet that is responsible for:
<ul>
    <li>Scanning the courses table and extracting the course codes</li>
    <li>Style the courses table to include a course names column and various other improvements</li>
    <li>Sending the extracted course codes to the "Server"</li>
    <li>Recieve the associated course names for each course code and fill in the table</li>
</ul>
<h2>Server</h2>
This is a AWS Lambda function (Flask + Serverless) that
<ul>
    <li>Stores information about UBC courses, primarily which course codes map to which course names</li>
    <li>Responding to requests (for course names) from the "Client"</li>
</ul>

<h2>Scraping</h2>
There is a technically a third component to the system, and this is the periodic web scraping of the UBC website, to
keep the course information updated on the "Server".
